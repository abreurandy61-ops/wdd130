        <p>Hello my name is Randy! I am a responsible and motivated person who enjoys learning new
            skills and helping
            others. I have
            experience working with people from different backgrounds, which has helped me develop
            strong
            communication and problem-solving skills. I like to stay organized, manage my time well,
            and work
            hard to achieve my goals. I am always open to improving myself and sharing what I learn
            with others.</p>

        <p>Santo Domingo is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic, located on the
            southern
            coast along the Caribbean Sea. Founded in 1496, it is the oldest continuously inhabited
            European
            city in the Americas and home to the Colonial Zone, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The

            major cultural, political, and economic hub, known for its rich history, vibrant music
            and
            nightlife, and a mix of modern urban life with well-preserved colonial architecture.
